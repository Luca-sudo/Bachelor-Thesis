\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduced Share to avoid Linear Type system
	\item Push the costs of function calls to the return type. 
	   \begin{itemize}
	   	\item The specific cost does not matter, keeps it clean.
	   \end{itemize}
	\item Use of environment E instead of heap and stack. Implementation is irrelevant.
	\item Introduce relaxation relation to streamline soundness proof
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Along with naming initial and residual resources. Makes language disambiguous.
	\end{itemize}
\item In order to keep let rule consistent w.r.t. potentials, adjust (T:let). 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Capacity relation to compare potential of types.
		\item Equivalent types to ensure base types are compatible.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
